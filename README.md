## About
  This Python project compilation is for prospective law schools to see! In this Python course, I reviewed lectures designated for each       section of various programming techniques. I completed coding challenges at the end of each lecture to test my knowledge, and applied what I learned from each section to create a project. Each project required all of the previous skills plus a new one in order to run efficiently. From start to finish, I have learned in depth about the essential basics of Python, variables, string methods, slicing, conditional statements, lists, tuples, dictionaries, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. By the end of this course, I have truly understood what a powerful a tool programming can be in the legal profession – and how fun it is to use.
  
### Project 1: Health Potion
    
    * Learned how to export external python modules into the code for added functionality.
    * Cast variables into different type.
    * Understood Python’s capacity of doing complex maths.
    
 ### Project 2: Hello You!
 
    * Learned various ways to create strings, their flexibility, and mechanics.
    * Utilized input method and create useful output messages using string concatenation and formatting.
    * Worked with incompatible datatypes.
    
 ### Project 3: Slicer
 
    * Collect user input and store it in a string variable.
    * Sliced that variable into smaller bits to get the user name and domain from the e-mail.
    * Utilized string formatting to create and output message for the user using the data that was provided.

 ### Project 4: Monty
 
    * Combined data structures with logic systems to create a database that can be continually updated and kept 
      in the computer’s memory.
    
 ### Project 5: Cinema
    
    * Applied data structures to create an assortment of films using dictionaries, strings, lists, while loops, 
      if statements, and user input updating variables.
    
 ### Project 6:Baby Simulator
 
    * Used while loops with a data structure to create an incessant feedback unless satisfied by a requirement.
    
 ### Project 7: Pig Latin Translator
 
    * Combined for loops with data structures to loop through words and convert them into pig latin. 
    * Get sentence from user, split sentence into words, loop through words, convert into pig latin, 
      put the words together, and output the final string.
    
 ### Project 8: Tic Tac Toe
 
    * Used functions in accordance with while loop to create an input/output game of tic tac toe.
    
 ### Project 9: Make a Coin
 
    * Created a class for a pound coin and given it variables to represent object state. 
    * Encapsulated states and separated them from interacting with other data.
    * Made several objects from that class and demonstrated how to access and edit those objects state variables.
    
 ### Project 10: All the Coins
 
    * Expanded on Project 9 using object-oriented programming principles class inheritance and polymorphism.
    * Created a parent class with it’s own set of functions for the coin classes in the previous project. 
    * Created a dictionary of data, unpacked it, ran it through a function, and then packed it down back into
      another dictionary.
    * Defined a coin class constructor to have class methods and accept all of that data.
    
 ### Project 11: Bank
 
    * Built upon Projects 9 & 10.
    * Created two classes that inherited from a superclass.
    * Used a str method to control how the output looks when you print.
